# QuoteFinder5
Hello!

This is a small Android app for showing inspirational quotes. The app has a landing page and a home page that shows quotes in a random order. There are two visible navigation buttons: Home and Favorites. We have also implemented a swipe function, that allows the user to navigate though the quotes. 

The idea behind the app was to test our programming skills and develop our ideas about object-oriented programming. We all ventured into this without any knowledge about Android Studio and even though we could not fully fulfill and implement all the features that we wanted, we still got out something from this experience. The project has helped us to improve on our people skills and how to work and respect the people in the team. 

Feel free to use our code or parts of it for other projects. 

Possible improvements

Enhance the swipe/fling functionality.
Stop duplicates from showing when browsing.
We have also tried to implement a category functionality for a user to browse through different genres of quotes. Because of time constraints we decided not to finish it. 
The favourites page and the add/remove favourite function.
In the master branch there is an implementation of a text file based “database” which is functional but when a user tries to shuffle through the quotes it tends to crash.
